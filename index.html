            <div><h3>Is my child ready for lessons?</h3></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Emotional readiness is crucial. Is your child eager to learn new
                tasks? Do they get frustrated and give up easily, or do they
                show commitment to learning? Are they able to focus for 30
                minutes at a time? Do they want to play the flute?
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you and your child have the time? Learning music takes a real
                time commitment in daily practicing, attending lessons, and
                involvement in special events throughout the year. Because
                parental involvement is such a crucial part of the Suzuki
                philosophy, this would require you to not only be present for
                each of these areas, but also to be actively involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Are you willing to make a long-term commitment? Learning music
                is rewarding, but it is also a process that takes time. In the
                beginning, establishing fundamentals can sometimes seem to take
                forever, but the work pays off down the road. Are you willing to
                stick through the frustrating periods as well as the exciting
                ones?
              </p>
              <p>
                Do lessons fit your budget? In addition to the studio tuition
                rate, families must be prepared to buy or rent an instrument,
                purchase Suzuki music/CDs and other materials, and be prepared
                to invest in opportunities outside the studio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Come observe a lesson! I highly encourage prospective students
                to observe one of my current students in their lesson so that
                you can get a feel for my teaching style and the child can be
                sure that learning the flute is something that they really want
                to pursue.

            <div>
              <p>
                My flute studio is based in the Denver Metro area, and I offer
                weekly private lessons to students from the age of 4 through
                adult seniors. I teach using the Suzuki Method, an approach that
                has been validated by many research studies as a very effective
                way to learn music (as well as other life-skills). The Suzuki
                Method is unique because it approaches music learning with the
                same principles as language acquisition. Specifically, it
                utilizes listening/imitation, repetition, delayed reading,
                creating a nurturing and supportive learning environment,
                building new skills with music already learned, and active
                parent involvement. Just as children learn language from a very
                young age, they can also begin to learn music when they are
                young. In fact, the early years are developmentally a crucial
                time for developing mental processes and muscle coordination,
                and music lessons are an effective way to maximize the child’s
                potential during this time of their life. The principles of the
                Suzuki Method not only provide a framework for learning new
                skills in young and beginner students, but they are also very
                effective for advanced players as they learn to perfect advanced
                skills and, nurture their own creativity and musical voice, and
                perform at a professional level.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although learning music is a primary goal of my studio, I also
                strive to teach students how to use music as a tool of
                expression, communication, and connection. Students will be
                challenged to build problem-solving skills, cultivate attention
                to detail, navigate complex mental and physical tasks, and
                develop resilience, perseverance, confidence, and self-efficacy.
                Even after students graduate or move on from my studio, they
                have a deep sense of pride and joy in music that sticks with
                them for a lifetime.
